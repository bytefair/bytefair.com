Auburn Leather Company is one of the United States' premier manufacturer of
world-class finished leather for fashion applications. As one of the few
remaining raw goods manufacturers in the US, Auburn stakes its claim in the
market on the exceptional quality of its leather. It does this buy purchasing
only the best hides and retaining the most skilled workforce in the industry.

Unfortunately as an industrial company that sells directly to manufacturers,
Auburn's marketing has occasionally taken a backseat to direct networking. While
this has kept the mills running, it hasn't shown off the beauty and quality of
their raw products and hasn't provided potential buyers with a good overview of
the catalog.

Our main goal in producing Auburn's new website was to provide a multiplatform
highlight of the products and the process using beautiful photography and
simple design that reflects the aesthetic and rich history of the factory.
